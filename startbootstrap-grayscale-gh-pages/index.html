                            H.I.M. (Hourglass Inverted Maniac) is not a simple ghost. He came from a Limbo or purgatory, and he wants to destroy the "Ecos", twisted shadows of his own memories, who are wandering for the Gray Hell trying to corrupt other souls.
                            Every time he destroys one, he recovers a fragment of his memory, but he suffers too. The way he attacks is blowing a firethrower, but it does not throw fire, it throws a black substance that consumes everything it touches.

                                Usually, he does not eat anything, as he is a ghost, but he is known to consume the fears and despair of the souls he torments.
                                As you can see, when he eats, he is black, and when he is not, he is white, so you can tell if he has eaten or not by his color,
                                and the entire background change too, so be careful.

                                        One of his abilities is to create illusions, so he can make his victims see what he wants them to see,
                                        and make them feel what he wants them to feel.

                                        in very bright areas, since he hates light. That is why he has been seen very few times.

                                    He has incredible vision thanks to his blue eye, which allows him to see his victims 
                                    from an almost impossible distance. However, his weaknesses are his inability to attack things that are familiar to him,
